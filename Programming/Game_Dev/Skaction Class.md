One of the more powerful features in SpriteKit is actions. Actions in SpriteKit are handled using the SKAction class, and they allow you to perform many types of operations on your nodes. For example, you can:

-   Change a node’s position and orientation.
-   Change a node’s size or scale properties.
-   Change a node’s visibility or make it translucent.
-   Change a sprite node’s contents so it animates through a series of textures.
-   Colorize a sprite node.
-   Play simple sounds.
-   Remove a node from the node tree.
-   Run a code block.
-   Invoke a selector on an object.
