- document of your code is vital thing in development. its helps you in several ways. 
	- helps to have a better understanding about the code you write. 
	- easily shows someone that what have you done. 
	- help you to write cleaner code 

- i have been search for example documentation that have been done related to app development but i only finds apple WWDC 23 sample apps documentation. 
- actually there is no template for the documentation because it get vary from the type of the application or framework that you are writing. 
- following template is made by me for my personal use. 
- this is heavily inspired by the documentation style of apple and their sample app documentation.
