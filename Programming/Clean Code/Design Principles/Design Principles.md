> Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. 

- always try to separate the aspects that vary in your code.
- in another way to think about this is to take the parts that vary and encapsulate them.
- so you can alter or extend the parts that vary without effecting those that not changing. 


> Program to an interface, not an implementation 

- rely on interfaces rather than implementing concrete classes.
