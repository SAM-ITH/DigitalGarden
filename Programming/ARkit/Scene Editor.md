- scene editor can be found when you expand the art.scnassets. 
![[scene_editor_view.png]]

##### Components of the scene editor 
- **viewport** - the middle part of the editor that contain the editor 
- **manipulator** - if you select the model you can see the manipulator. its the coordinate system that represent the x and y axis that you can rotate your object 
- **viewport Controls" - 
- **Scene graph view" - 

###### Inspectors 
- its right panel that side beside the viewport. its separated into multiple tabs. 
	- File inspector 
	- Quick help inspector 
	- Node inspector 
	- Attributes inspector 
	- Material Inspector 
	- Physics Inspector 
	- Scene Inspector 

most of the time we use only node, attributes and material inspectors 

#### Node Inspector
- node inspector have transform property. its involve in the change of the node such as position, rotation and scale all together. 
![[transform in node inspector.png]]
- position 
	- the position is the where i place my model. it composed of 3D coordinates of x,y and z.
- Euler angles 
	- Euler angel enable to rotate model in pitch.

- scale 
	- scale allow us to size up and size down 
- Bounding box 
	- bounding box is the dimensions of our asset in meters.

#### Materials 

- Diffuse - its the skin that wraps the object. in staring example of Xcode underneath the ship asset their is a texture.png this refer as a diffuse.
	- before and after diffuse to an object
