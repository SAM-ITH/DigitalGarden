### layers of ARKit
- ARKit can be divided into 3 layers. these layers are working together simultaneously. 
	- Tracking 
	- Scene understanding 
	- Rendering 

#### Tracking 
Tracking is the key function of ARKit. it allows us to track a device's position, location and orientation in the real world. 

#### Scene Understanding 
Understanding the scene means that ARKit analyses the environment presented by the cameraâ€™s view, then adjust the scene or provide information on it. This is what enables the detection of all the surfaces in the physical world such as the floor or a flat surface. Then, it will allow us to place a virtual object on it. Also, the light estimation can be integrated to lit a virtual object simulating a light source in the physical world. 

#### Rendering 
ARKit uses technologies to handle the processing of the 3D models and present them in our scene. such as 
- Metal 
- SceneKit 
- Third party tools like Unity of Unreal Engine
