#### what is MVC 
- M - model
	- we can simply think models as our data layer. basically structure of our data.  
	- for example, lets have a user model. it has things like first name, last name, email, phone number etc.
	- we can create model a either using struct or class.
- V - view 
	- things that we can see on our device. 
	- for an example text fields, buttons and labels. 

- C - controller 
	- controller work as the middle man of your view and model 
	- when view trigger particular event, controller listen to those events and got to the model and retrieve any data if needed.
	- controller is the one in charge that make sure things are connected end to end. 

- in UIkit they have combine view and controller and create the ViewController
