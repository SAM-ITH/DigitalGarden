- this communication method is used to communicate between two view controllers. 
- so this is a one to one communication method. 
- best analogy to replicate this scenario to think about it as a boss and intern.
	- intern doesn't know anything and boss know what need to be done 
	- screen that has all the information is the boss screen. screen that get the data and act according to that is knows as the intern screen.
