- basic things that i found that will help me with on the road 
	- hugging face - github for large language models 
	- runpods - GPU server renting place for run machine learning models 
	- thebloke - hugging face dude that creating more efficient language models. every one is using his models i dont know why

- most easiest way that i found to host language model and create an API is by using the runpods. but they asking for minimum top up of 25$ so thats can not be done in my current financial status so i have to find a cost effective way. following video is the best video that  i found to do this via runpods

- for now the best way to do this is using AWS sage maker.
