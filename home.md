## Hi Wellcome!

Hi, my name is Samith Wijesinghe. I am a **Robotics** 🦾 enthusiast that obsessed with crafting new apps and designs in** ****iOS***📱. Loved creating new things that were fun and meaningful for others. Also, have a keen interest in design principles and design systems both in app development and product development. I currently hold a bachelor’s degree 🎓  in software engineering and am finishing off my second one in mechatronics engineering. I have started my career as a researcher specialised in Soft Robotics Application Development and prototyping. along the way I have enter several competitions organised by Harvard and MIT for soft robotics as a team. My hobbies are trading 📈 and investing in financial markets. You might find it an odd hobby, but I loved financial markets since I was a teenager. I developed prediction models using machine learning to predict the forex market based on the market news and trends. This started as a pet project, but with time I am able to publish a paper from this project. after i walk through many fields finally i settle down in software engineering due to my love of creating apps so Now i am working👨🏻‍💻 as an iOS developer. i am mainly focus on iOS app development , core fundamentals of programming, building apps that not boring** 😅 and AR related frameworks 🙃
