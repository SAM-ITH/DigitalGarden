## creating game assets for a game

When it comes to making visual assets for your games, the rule of thumb to follow is known as the power of two. Simply put, the power of two rule states that either one or both of the following conditions must be met:

-   The width and/or height of the image should be divisible by 8.
-   The width and/or height of the image can be doubled-up or divided-down by 2.

In other words, any image that is 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 2048 pixels (or higher) in width and/or height is considered valid and properly optimized. When an image is properly optimized, it tends to load faster, and the graphics pipeline can take advantage of other optimizations.
