## Things that game design document should include
-   A short description of the game, including the genre.
    
-   Character bios and/or descriptions of the main characters, enemies, and other key players in the game. 
    
-   Location and/or scene information—especially if your game is story-driven.
    
-   Any design considerations, concept art, and mock-ups. The GDD is a good place to decide the game’s art style and camera angle.
    
-   Level design ideas. Are the levels randomly generated or made purposefully? Is your game an endless runner, or are there distinct levels the player must clear before moving on to the next?
    
-   Music and sound ideas or examples that will help set the tone of your game.
    
-   The gameplay mechanics, such as items and power-ups, goals and challenges, and movement and control systems.
