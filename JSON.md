## what is JSON?
- json is a standard data format, that often use for the response data.
- most of the time json data is come as a value pair and array data type.
- there are three main parts to understand in json format.
	1) key value pairs 
	2) json object
	3) json array

---
### key value pairs 

``` 
"first name" : "Samith"

```
### A JSON Object

```
{
"firstName" : "samith",
"lastName" : "wijesinghe"
}
```

when key value pair is wrapped with curly brace it called json object 

### JSON Array

``` 
{
"names" : [
{
"firstName" : "samith",
"lastName" : "wijesinghe"
},
{
"firstName" : "hasini",
"lastName" : "wijesinghe"
}
]
}
```
if we put a square brackets around set of json objects it's called as a json array.

- in a json value part can become a whole json object or json array.
