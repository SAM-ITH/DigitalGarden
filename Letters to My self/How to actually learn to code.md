- first thing i need to accept is that i have been stuck in a tutorial hell for the past couple of years 
- thats the main reason i can not code anything without a tutorial 
- For start coding something you only need to know these three things from any language 
	- variables 
	- loops 
	- conditionals 
	- functions 
- next things is never watch any kind of tutorial until you can code some sort of programme without looking at anything 

### Question driven development 
- first you think about an end goal (eg: weather app)
- then divide in to serious of question to how to do it 
- try to create simple things that not going more than 100 lines code 
	- you can find these thing by searching for google as `begineers exercise to swift or begineers problems for swift `
- after you have a practice on that i can go for clone existing apps. 
- this way i have no need to worry about the UI also no need to be the exact app just build crapy working clone 

### You might need tutorials also at the end of the day? 
- for face this there is a new way.
- first just watch the videos write down the important task in the tutorial 
- after that build some smaller projects related to those tasks
