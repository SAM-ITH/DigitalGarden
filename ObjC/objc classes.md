### Objective-C is loaded with classes 
- everything in an iOS app is defined as a class somewhere in the code that we write 

- in objective-c class always have an interface and an implementation.
	- *interface*
		- interface declares what our class can do and how its going to used by other objects 
		- interface is also the place that you declare whether your class inherit from anything.
		- also the instance variable, properties and methods also declare their.
	- *implementation*
		- the implementation files is how your class does what your interface claims it can do
		- other objects doesn't care about how you implement something as long as they know that you can do it.
