- **typecasting** is converting a object of a one type to another.
- typecasting comes in swift with three forms.
	- as ? - optional down casting 
		this means i know this conversion might be true but it might fail
	- as ! - forced down casting
		i know this conversion is true and if i am wrong, i love to see my app is crashing.
